## Example 46
* This example is about coding convention checking:
  * <https://github.com/ruiwu1990/coding_convention_tool>
* How to use external executable file in your application.
  * Python: subprocess
  * Four steps:
    * Prepare command
    * Open log files
    * Execute external file
    * Wait until it is done.
