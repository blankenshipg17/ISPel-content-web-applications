## Web Page Design
* Many things you need to consider: layout, color design, contents… 
* First, there is a job named “web designer”: https://study.com/articles/Web_Designer_Job_Description_Duties_and_Requirements.html
* Possible rules you may follow:
  * Clean and only highlight important things
  * Logo, make people easy to remember your website
  * Fixed sidebar navigation
  * …
* There is no such a rule always working…
* If you feel comfortable, that is good enough for <font color=red>this class</font>.

## Web Page Design: Flat Design
* Wiki: flat design is a minimalist user interface (UI) design genre, or design language, commonly used in graphical user interfaces.
* Interface design emphasizing minimum use of stylistic elements
  * Avoid: illusion of three dimensions, e.g. use of drop shadows, gradients or textures
  * Use: bold shapes, colors, images (e.g., icons)

* Examples: 
  * <https://www.microsoft.com/>
    * Microsoft official website.
  * <https://d3js.org/>
    * A very powerful data visualization library

* Realism Design Example
  * <https://www.apple.com/iphone-12/>
    * Apple website, need to use Chrome browser

* Flat design <font color=red>advantages</font>:
  * It is easier to <font color=red>quickly convey</font> information while still looking visually appealing and approachable. 
  * It makes it easier to design an interface that is <font color=red>responsive</font> to changes in browser size across different devices. 
  * It enables a user to <font color=red>focus</font> on the contents.
  * With minimal design elements, websites are able to load <font color=red>faster and resize easily</font>.
  * Still look sharp on <font color=red>high-definition</font> screens.
