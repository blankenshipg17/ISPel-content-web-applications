## Paper Prototyping
* Software prototyping (wiki): Software prototyping is the activity of creating prototypes of software applications, i.e., incomplete versions of the software program being developed.
  * Demo functions
  * Can be completely different from your final product.
* Paper prototyping: created with paper, present your design ideas
* Google also uses paper prototyping (from 3:25): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMjozqJS44M>

## Paper Prototyping: How
* Step 1: Create sketches / wireframes of the feature you’re working on
* Step 2: Gather some paper, pens, markers, scissors, and maybe some cardboard if you have them.
* Step 3. Cut out the individual components of your prototype.
* Step 4. Play around with your prototype to make sure that you have all the pieces you need for what you want to test
*Step 5. Create a video to record the user flow

## Paper Prototyping: Example

* A video can help record the user flow of your paper prototyping
* An example about mobile app: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y20E3qBmHpg>
* An example about web page paper prototyping: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FCyKf_5qRU>
* These videos are very good except it does not include color design.
* Another video about user test using paper prototype testing: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h0Fj04c_vM>


## Paper Prototyping Pros vs Cons
* What are the benefits of paper prototyping?
  * User flows: e.g., can simulate user interactions
  * Rapid sketches: can be done very fast
  * Easy and cheap: cost is very low and is not hard to create a prototype
* No need programming knowledge: draw and cut
  * What are the disadvantages?
  * A user may interact differently with paper compared with actual computer GUIs
  * Some interactivities are hard to be demoed. E.g., play a video.

## Group Homework 3 (Part 1)
* “Is my classmate a vampire?” Project design
  * Decide based on four features (shadow, garlic, complexion, and accent)
  * A user can input his/her classmate features
  * Threshold-based method will be introduced in Homework 3 (Part 2).
* Create a paper prototype.
* At least have <font color=red>four</font> web pages, such as team member introduction, with <font color=red>four</font> user interactions, such as classmate feature input form.
* Record the user flow of your paper prototype (maybe with your phone)
* <font color=red>No need</font> to submit anything until HW3 Part 2 is introduced.

## BootStrap tutorial
* Based on: <https://www.w3schools.com/booTsTrap/default.asp>
* Bootstrap is a free front-end <font color=red>framework</font> for faster and easier web development
* Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs
* <font color=red>Responsive web design</font> is about creating web sites which automatically adjust themselves to look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops. (mobile friendly)
