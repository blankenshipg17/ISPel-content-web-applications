## Domain Name System
* Servers do not recognize your domain name.
* Banner ID (IP address) vs Name (domain name)
* The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized <font color=red>naming system</font> for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network (Wiki).
* It can provide you IP address based on a domain name (similar to your contact app).
